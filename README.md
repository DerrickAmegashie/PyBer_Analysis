# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of PyBer_Analysis

The project involved an analysis for PyBer, a ride sharing app company. The first task was to perform an exploratory analysis on a very large csv files. I created several types of visualizations  to tell a compelling story about the data. I developed python scripts using pandas library, jupyter notebooks and matplotlib to create a variety of charts that showcases the relationship between the type of city and the number of drivers and rides as well as the percentage of total fares, riders and drivers by type of city. These analysis will help PyBer improve access to ride sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods
Once I completed the above task, I was further tasked to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Using Pandas and Matplotlib, I created a multiple line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.

## PyBer_Analysis & Results

### Analysis
The total  number of rides for each city type is retrieved?
                - Rural – 125
                - Suburban – 625
                - Urban – 1625

The total number of drivers for each city type is retrieved?
                Rural – 78
                Suburban – 490
                Urban - 2405

The sum of the fares for each city type is retrieved?
Rural - $4,327.93
Suburban - $19,356.33
Urban - $39,854.38

The average fare per ride for each city type is calculated?
Rural –  $34.623440
Suburban - $30.970128
Urban - $24.525772

The average fare per driver for each city type is calculated ?
Rural - $55.486282
Suburban - $39.502714
Urban - $16.571468

A PyBer summary Dataframe is created.
There was a reduction in the medium range (1000 – 2000)

The PyBer Sumarry Data Frame is formatted?

A multiple-line chart of total fares for each city type.



   ###Summary of PyBer
The chart shows that:
Urban city’s have more access and can afford the rie sharing
Rural city’s are the bottom of the  chat and are affected the most
In the month of April, Suburban city type had an increase while both Rural and Urban decreased.
